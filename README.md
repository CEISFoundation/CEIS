## The Community Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

A frustating thing about the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is that you have to register to submit a sequence. They demandd your address and proof of "identity". This can be very invasive for those who are underage or simply enjoy privacy. As a way to bypass that, I have created the CEIS. You can submit any sequence anonymously. You must input at least 4 terms, the rules of the sequence, the name (you can name it anything you want).
